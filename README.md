Bloc Jams is a jQuery-driven music player app similar to Spotify that I used to learn frontend web development. 

I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript/jQuery.

Check out Bloc Jams and explore the music player's functionality. [Click here to view the live site](https://claireblocjams.netlify.com/).
