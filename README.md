Welcome to Bloc Jams!

Bloc Jams is a jQuery-driven music player app similar to Spotify that I used to learn frontend web development. 

I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and implemented interactivity with JavaScript/jQuery.
